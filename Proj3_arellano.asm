; Description:	Introduces the program and greets the user.
;				Asks the user for their name. 
;				Repeatedly asks for user input in ranges [-200, -100] or [-5-, -1] until a positive number is given by the user. 
;				If input is not within either range, then the user is asked for another number. Invalid number is thrown away. 
;				If no user input is detected, then an error message is displayed.
;				Valid inputs are checked against current min and max values and set accordingly. 
;				Once a positive number is detected, calculations are done to get total (valid input) sum, rounded average, and decimal average. 
;				The total valid input count, minimum, maximum, total sum, rounded average, and decimal average are displayed. 
;				Finally, a farewell message is displayed

; Greets the user by their name and displays instructions. 
; Instructions: Enter number in range [-200,-100] or [-50,-1]. When done, 
; enter a positive number to display calculations.
